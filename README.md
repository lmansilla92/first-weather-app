# First Weather App

## Repository

In this repository you will find the application code to a weather app. The purpose of this application is to provide an easy way to search a city's weather by typing in the city name. The API requests return data that display the current weather, along with a 5-day forecast. The current weather will be displayed at the top section which is larger than the section that holds the 5 day forecast. The following information will be displayed if the fetch is successful:

- City Name
- Date
- A weather icon from the Open Weather API
- Temperature
- Wind
- Humidity

The biggest challenge I had during the proccess of making thie application was getting the 5 day forecoast to display exactly how I wanted it to. The second biggest challenge was working with local storage to get the search history buttons to appear and get them to call the API fetch when clicked on. It wasn't necessarily getting this to work but more so, fixing bugs that were caused because of the way I wrote the code. It took meticulous inspection of my own code and running it multiple times to find ways where I could improve and help get rid of some of the bugs that were happening.
